# Zigzag

#### Zigzag is a game made using unity. The goal is to try not to make your car through this zigzag line without falling. There are 3 levels. Instructions to play Zigzag, controls and contribution details are listed down below.

## Controls
Controls are pretty simple. The car automatically moves, you just have to click to turn your car in the zigzags direcction. 

## Scoring of zigzag
There are 2 ways to earn points. First, everytime you tap the screen to turn your car, you will earn 1 point. Although, you can increase that number by collecting blue diamonds, each blue diamond will increase your rate of score by 1. The second way is to collect red or green diamonds. Red diamonds boost your score by 1 point, while green diamonds boost your score by 4 points. Obviously, blue diamonds are the rarest, then are green diamonds, and ofcourse red diamonds are the most common.
